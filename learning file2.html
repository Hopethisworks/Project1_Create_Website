                    I've learned terminology like <em>tags</em> and <em>elements</em> (tag - content - tag) in HTML.  I have learned that there are different types of tags, some require <a href="http://www.google.com">attributes</a> and some impact the text by putting it in a "box" (the<em>"block"</em> elements.) The body of the web page is most important, and is the focus of this learning.  Complex information is in the header, and is important also. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    I've learned that computers will follow these direction precisely, even if they are <b>incorrect</b> directions.

                    <p>
                    I've learned that repetition wastes time and can introduce errors.

                        <div class="focus">
                            <strong>I've learned not to sweat remembering details that I can look it up.</strong> <!--I removed the tag "Center" after I learned about css.  BUT I was really proud that I figured "Center" out all on my own.-->

                    <p>
                        The important things to take away from this are: <br>
                        1. HTML controls the "structure" of a web page <br>
                        2. CSS controls the "style" of a page (how it looks).<br>
                        3. When programmers talk about the "DOM" they are talking about the tree-like structure of a page. <br><br>
                        To learn more about "tree-like structure" refer (look it up if you forget!) to the wikipedia article on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_structure">Tree Structures.</a>

                <h2> Learning about CSS</h2>

                    <p>
                    CSS is a cascading style sheet, and is a way to define how you want your <em> class </em> to look.  It makes a lot more sense when you realize that <em> class </em> is a user-defined field, and you define the field in the style sheet. This significantly contributes to reduced repetition and also makes all of your similar elements look and behave the same.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    In CSS, code comments begin with /* and end with */.

                <h2> Box Sizing</h2>
                <div class="concept">
                <p>
                HTML elements are boxes and each box has 4 components (center out: content, padding, border, margin.) If you set sizing in % instead of pixels, it will re-size more properly on different size screens.  Also , it is important to set the box-sizing attribute to every element to this:<br>
                <span class="focus">* {
        -webkit-box-sizing: border-box;
        -moz-box-sizing: border-box;
        -ms-box-sizing: border-box;
        box-sizing: border-box;
    } </span>
    			</p>
                <p>
    Some other tips:<br>
                1. 	Adding the rule display: flex; to the appropriate CSS will let divs appear next to each other but only when the sum is less than 100%. <br>
                2. Look for Natural Boxes <br>
                3. Look for repeated styles and semantic elements<br>
                4. Write your HTML<br>
                5. Apply Styles<br>
